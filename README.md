# US Rental Housing Analytics

## Project Overview
This project analyzes rental housing trends across different states in the United States using visualization, clustering, and regression modeling. By examining key attributes such as location, pet-friendliness, number of amenities, apartment size, and rental price, the project aims to segment the rental market and identify factors influencing rental prices.

The insights generated may be valuable for stakeholders including landlords, renters, investors, and policymakers to understand patterns in rental pricing and the influence of various property attributes.
